## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

This research utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze global water resource utilization, economic indicators, and climate trends.

## Current Progress

- Data collection and preprocessing completed, including feature engineering, filtering missing data and regression-based imputation for natural disasters.
  - [ðŸ§  R Code ](https://github.com/1798bebe/Statistical-Research-with-R/blob/main/preprocessing/preprocessing.R) (completed)

- PCA used for dimensionality reduction, and DBSCAN applied to selected features after a full grid search. Clustering evaluated using a composite score based on the Silhouette coefficient and Daviesâ€“Bouldin index, with filters on cluster balance and label coverage.
  - [ðŸ“„ Report (PDF)](https://github.com/1798bebe/Statistical-Research-with-R/blob/main/unsupervised%20learning(PCA%2C%20clustering)/report_unsupervised_learning.pdf) (completed)
