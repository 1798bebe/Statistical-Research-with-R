## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

Water is a fundamental resource essential for human survival, economic development, and environmental stability. Yet growing water stress concernsâ€”driven by population dynamics, climate change, and economic activityâ€”pose a major global challenge. A deep understanding of waterâ€‘use dynamics, and their links to economic and climate factors, is therefore critical for informed policymaking and sustainable management.

This study analyzes global and countryâ€‘level waterâ€‘use patterns by combining classical statistical techniques with machine learning workflows in R. Water-related variables were examined through a structured pipeline comprising exploratory data analysis, supervised learning(binary classification), unsupervised learning(PCA & clustering), and timeâ€‘series forecasting. A major emphasis was placed on rigorous validation and evaluation, such as constructing a reliable analytical workflow, optimizing model performance, critically reviewing assumptions and limitations, and examining generalizability of the modelsâ€”to ensure that all findings are both reliable and applicable.
