# Machine Learning-Based Statistical Analysis of Global Water Resource Utilization, Economic Factors, and Climate Trends Using R

This research utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze global water resource utilization, economic indicators, and climate trends.

## Current Progress

- Data has been collected and preprocessing has been completed.
- Missing data has been filtered and regression imputation has been applied to fill in missind data in GDP per capita dataset. 

## Next Steps 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend and Cyclical Pattern Analysis
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Time Series Forecasting
- Visualization and Interpretation
- Policy Recommendations
- Final Report Completion

## Deadline

Project will be completed by **14th April**.
