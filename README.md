## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

This research utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze global water resource utilization, economic indicators, and climate trends.

## Current Progress

- Data collection and preprocessing completed, including filtering missing data and regression-based imputation for GDP per capita.
- Feature engineering completed (GDP in USD, available resources, GDP in PPP).
- PCA conducted for dimensionality assessment and K-means clustering applied on selected features, evaluated using Silhouette and Davies-Bouldin indices.
- Time series forecasting completed using ARIMA and Prophet models on Germany's freshwater withdrawals, with scenario-based policy recommendations developed according to potential drivers of   the trend.

## Next Steps 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Trend and Cyclical Pattern Analysis
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Final Report Completion (Including Visualization and Interpretation and Policy Recommendations)

## Deadline

Project will be completed by **21st April**.
