## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

This research utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze global water resource utilization, economic indicators, and climate trends.

## Current Progress

- Data collection and preprocessing completed, including feature engineering, filtering missing data and regression-based imputation for GDP per capita.
- PCA conducted for dimensionality reduction, followed by K-means clustering on selected features, evaluated using Silhouette and Davies-Bouldin indices.
- Time series forecasting completed using ARIMA and Prophet on Germanyâ€™s freshwater withdrawals, with scenario-based policy recommendations derived from potential trend drivers.
