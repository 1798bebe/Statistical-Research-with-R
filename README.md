## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

This research utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze global water resource utilization, economic indicators, and climate trends.

## Current Progress

- Data collection and preprocessing completed, including filtering missing data and regression-based imputation for GDP per capita.
- Feature engineering completed (GDP in USD, available resources, GDP in PPP).
- PCA conducted for dimensionality assessment.
