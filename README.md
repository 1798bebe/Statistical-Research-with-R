## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

Water is a fundamental resource essential for human survival, economic development, and environmental stability. Yet growing water stress concernsâ€”driven by population dynamics, climate change, and economic activityâ€”pose a major global challenge. A deep understanding of waterâ€‘use dynamics, and their links to economic and climate factors, is therefore critical for informed policymaking and sustainable management.

This study analyzes global and countryâ€‘level waterâ€‘use patterns by combining classical statistical techniques with machine learning workflows in R. Key variablesâ€”sectoral freshwater withdrawals, waterâ€‘stress indicators, economic metrics, and climate trendsâ€”were examined through a structured pipeline comprising exploratory data analysis, supervised classification of populationâ€‘growth categories, unsupervised country profiling, and timeâ€‘series forecasting of water demand. A major emphasis was placed on rigorous validation and evaluationâ€”statistical testing of model performance, diagnostic assessment of underlying assumptions and limitations, sensitivity and robustness analyses, and systematic hyperparameter optimizationâ€”to ensure that all findings are both reliable and policyâ€‘relevant.
