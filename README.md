## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

This research utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze global water resource utilization, economic indicators, and climate trends.

## Current Progress

- Data collection and preprocessing completed, including feature engineering, filtering missing data and regression-based imputation for natural disasters.
  - [ðŸ§  R Code ](https://github.com/1798bebe/Statistical-Research-with-R/blob/main/preprocessing/preprocessing.R) (completed)

- Supervised learning applied to classify country populationâ€‘growth via nested CV (Random Forest, XGBoost, GLMNET, randomâ€‘baseline) with F1â€‘optimized randomâ€‘search tuning, pairwise Wilcoxon tests, GLMNET interpretability (odds ratios, variable importance, PDPs) and choropleth misclassification mapping.
  - [ðŸ§  R Code ]([https://github.com/1798bebe/Statistical-Research-with-R/blob/main/preprocessing/preprocessing.R](https://github.com/1798bebe/Statistical-Research-with-R/blob/main/Supervised%20Learning%20(Regression%2C%20Classification)/binary%20classification.R)) (completed)
  
- Unsupervised learning applied to water-related indicators using PCA and clustering (K-means, DBSCAN, hierarchical), with exhaustive grid search across feature subsets and parameters; policy-relevant cluster profiles derived from the best configuration.
  - [ðŸ“„ Report (PDF)](https://github.com/1798bebe/Statistical-Research-with-R/blob/main/unsupervised%20learning(PCA%2C%20clustering)/report_unsupervised_learning.pdf) (completed)
