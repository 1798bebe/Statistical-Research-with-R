## Statistical Research: Water Resource Analysis with R

This research utilizes statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze global water resource utilization, economic indicators, and climate trends.

## Current Progress

- Data collection and preprocessing completed, including filtering missing data and regression-based imputation for GDP per capita.
- Feature engineering completed (GDP in USD, available resources, GDP in PPP).
- PCA conducted for dimensionality assessment.
- K-means clustering applied on selected features and evaluated using Silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz indices and cluster profiles summarized and saved as a labeled dataset.

## Next Steps 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend and Cyclical Pattern Analysis
- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Time Series Forecasting
- Visualization and Interpretation
- Policy Recommendations
- Final Report Completion

## Deadline

Project will be completed by **14th April**.
